# Simulation-of-error-detection-correction-code---CRC

CRC stands for Cyclic Redundancy Check. It was invented by W. Wesley Peterson in 1961. It is an error detecting technique through which we can detect the error in digital networks(or communication channel or digital data) and storage devices. It is used to trace the accidental changes in the digital data.


 It is an error detection mechanism in which a special number is added to the block of data. The primary goal to add the number is to identify the changes during the transmission or storage. It is calculated twice, once at the sender side during the data transmission and recalculated at the receiver side.
