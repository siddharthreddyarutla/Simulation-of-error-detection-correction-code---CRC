# Simulation-of-error-detection-correction-code---CRC
 It is an error detection mechanism in which a special number is added to the block of data. The primary goal to add the number is to identify the changes during the transmission or storage. It is calculated twice, once at the sender side during the data transmission and recalculated at the receiver side.
